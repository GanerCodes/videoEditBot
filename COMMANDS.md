Commands
===========

These are commands that the bot supports.

A command is declared as `filtername=value`. For example, to add 100 bass boost, use `bass=100`.

To use multiple commands, use a comma `,` to separate them. For example, bass boost + hypercam would be `bass=100, hypercam`.
(You can also use pipes `|` to separate groups of commands to be processed. For example, `ytp=100|hcycle=3` is like running ytp=100 and running hcycle=3 on the output video).

To use the bot on Discord, prefix your command with "destroy". An empty command or "random" selects random parameters.
